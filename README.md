      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>Tic-tac-toe, also known as "noughts and crosses" or "Xs and Os", is a simple game played by two players on a three-by-three grid. Players take turns marking a space with either an "X" or an "O". The goal is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all spaces are filled and no one has three in a row, the game is a tie. Tic-tac-toe is a solved game, meaning that with best play from both players, the game will always end in a draw</p>
